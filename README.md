# Red_Black_Tree_Snake

This game was made as a school project.
It uses JFrame to for the graphics of the game.

The way this game will implement the Red_Black Binary tree is by adding a random number to the cherry's that the Snake will "eat". The moment the Snake reaches the cherry, in console, we will see the number of the cherry. The first number will never move anywhere, that first number is the root. All the other numbers will either move left or right, depending on whether or not the number is higher than the one that's compared to. If the cherry number is higher that the "leaf" point, it will go to the left and it will go to the right if it's higher than the "leaf". The moment the rotations will find an empty spot, it will be placed there.
